## Mutageneic oligo design for Kunkel 

Tools for oligo design can be found in `oligo_design/`, along with a pre-generated list of all possible mutagenic oligos for Kunkel. 

## Records of Sanger sequencing from the BglB project 

Scripts and records of orders for the Bagel project can be found in `orders/`. Each order includes Transcriptic formatter and automatic sequencing checker for rapid evaluation of sequencing results.

## Algorithmic verification of Sanger sequencing results 

Jupyter notebook for interactive algorithmic validation of Sanger results can be found in each order, and an example notebook is in the root directory as `validate_sequencing.ipynb`.
